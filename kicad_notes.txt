	How to Make KiCAD Footprints Local and Project-Unique

KiCad annoyances:
* Copy/Paste WOW!!!
	Cant copy between schematics, instead append sheet then delete!
	
* No separate select + command, instead:
	** Left select : Move
	** Shift + Left Select : Copy
	** Ctrl + Left Select : Drag
	** Alt + Left Select : Rotate
	** Ctrl + Shift + Left Select : Delete
* Many things cause complete redraw (For example del component takes 5 sec, when want to delete a few things)
* @todo Check this : Moving components in schematic disconnects their wire links!
* @todo Verify : Weird doesn't show power ports on components.
* @todo Verify : How to manage placing multiple parts of same component
* No "search" for footprints by name, need to know what library it is in
* No "measurement" tool in footprint editor. Often want to check existing components and need to do it all manually
* Wont let you import design rules file loke other software. PCB fab houses provide these files often with their limitations




2x15 pin NodeMCU 
grid using 1.27 mm default

1400 mil?
2.54 * 15 = 

525 pix
85 pix
W
440 pix between pin 1 center and 15 center 
19.05 + 16.51 = 35.56 distance between center pin 1 and pin 15

453 - 166 = distance between middle inside pins = 287 pix

287 pix = ?? mm
440 pix = 35.65 mm

?? = 287 * 35.65 / 440 = 23.25352272727273


x = 900 mils
1.27 = 50mils
x = 22.86 mm


x mm = Ymils * 1.27 / 50

SOIC-16_ADAPTER_3.9x9.9mm_Pitch1.27mm

PDIP 7.62 OR 10.16 wide

spec say 0.310 inches = 7.62mm
and the adapter is a 10.16mm DIP


Multiple footprints for single component
Hi,

I am trying to create a prototype PCB which can be populated with different package types for the same component. 

For example, it uses the MCP3208 chip which comes in a SOIC-16 or a DIP-16 package.

These correspond to the standard KiCad footprints:
* Housings_DIP:DIP-16_W7.62mm 
* Housings_SOIC:SOIC-16_3.9x9.9mm_Pitch1.27mm

Basically, I want others to be free to choose the SMT or THT package to populate the board with and not force a specific package.

What would be the best way to achieve this is in KiCad?

I started creating my own footprint that includes both other footprints with a track drawn between them, but thought there might be another way to achieve this using the standard footprints.
