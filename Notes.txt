PCB Manufacturer decision

Looking at selection website: https://pcbshopper.com/

Decided to choose EasyEDA, its limits we specified at:
https://easyeda.com/Doc/Tutorial/PCBOrder.htm

I verified the limits I set were within EasyEDA limits

I choose to export protel gerber file extensions and had to rename the IoTaWattHB-Edge.Cuts.gm1 to IoTaWattHB-Edge.Cuts.gml

Pushbutton switch on GPIO

I think if we can configure the NodMCU GPIO10 to be Input with Hi-Z (66k apparently) when not flashing, and to OUTPUT which can provide 3.3V @12mA when flashing, then we might be able to safely use the switch and effectively "ignore" presses on it while flashing.

12mA per GPIO max, if we want to put limiting resistor for say 6mA @ 3.3V

I have added hardware to try and permit us to multiplex the usage of the GPIO10 for this purpose.

@todo Add link for GPIO10 usage examples previously discussed on forums of NodeMCU. Maybe: http://smarpl.com/content/esp8266-esp-201-module-freeing-gpio9-and-gpio10

Mounting hole specs

Decided to use M2 bolts for board, so using following to determine mounting hole sizes:
https://blogs.mentor.com/tom-hausherr/blog/tag/pcb-mounting-holes/

Using loose fit hole for board mount (long board):
2.45 hole
4.5 pad
courtyard: 4.6

For tight fit hole:
2.1 hole
4.1 pad
courtyard: 4.6

Via rules

Recommend 8mil via : My personal rule is to make the drill size diameter the same as the width of the trace, and the pad size roughly twice the diameter.

Other rules

* board-edge setback requirements (typically 10 to 25 mils (0.25mm to 0.6mm) that keep copper features away from the edge of the board.
* From https://www.expresspcb.com/tips-for-designing-pcbs/:
** 0.006" ??       : 0.1524mm : 6mil
** 0.008" ??       : 0.2032mm : 8mil
** 0.010″ 0.3 Amps : 0.254mm : 10mil
** 0.015″ 0.4 Amps : 0.381mm : 15mil
** 0.020″ 0.7 Amps : 0.508mm : 20mil
** 0.025″ 1.0 Amps : 0.635mm : 25mil
** 0.050″ 2.0 Amps : 1.27mm
** 0.100″ 4.0 Amps
** 0.150″ 6.0 Amps
* It is a common practice to restrict the direction that traces run to horizontal, vertical, or 45 degree angles.
