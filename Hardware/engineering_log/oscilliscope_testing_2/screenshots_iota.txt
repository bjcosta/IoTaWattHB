All loaded using switching regul
1 : 
2: 
3 : opamp out using switching reg
4 : opamp out using switching reg (scaled smaller)
5 : opamp out lower wave zoom
6 : input from plugpack
7 : input from plugpack with zoom lower wave
8,9: diff input no load
10: diff input no load NO CAPS input
11 : diff input no load NO CAPS output+input
12 : opamp out no load no caps
13 : opamp out no load no caps (just bottom)
14 : opamp out LOADED no caps
15 : opamp out LOADED no caps (zoom in single wave)
	when connected to the ADC, looks very fuzzy. Seams ADC has impact pulling voltage down
	when reconnect outcap, the fuzzing is much less
16 : with outcap, showing light fuzzing from ADC
17: no output cap, showing big fuzzing from ADC
